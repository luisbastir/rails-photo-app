# Finance Tracker

Ths is a demo app made with Ruby on Rails v 5.

## Demo Requirements

1. Authentication system, users can sign-up, edit their profile, log in/logout

2. Users can track stocks, upto 10 per user. the profile page will dosplay all the current stock prices

3. Users can search for stock symbols using a search bar

4. Users can choose to add a stock from results of search to their portafolio

5. Users can look for friends, or other users of the app, by name (first or last or email)

6. Users can view portafolio of stock their friends are tracking for investing ideas

7. Must be mobile firnedly, so the styling has to be responsive

## Considerations

* Need fast development, styling not of utmost importance but needs to look presentable

* No test framework required at his time since we'are building a prototype fast to display at an invertors gathering

* What's importat is the core functionality, time and presentation
